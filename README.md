In the City Latitude vs. Cloudiness plot, there is no correlation between latitude and cloudiness. However, data points are clustered around cloudiness percentages that are multiples of 10, indicating that the numbers have either been rounded or recording methods are imprecise.

In the City Latitude and Wind Speed plot, most data points fall below the 20 mph wind speed grid line.

In the City Latitude vs Temperature plot, cities closest to the equator (latitude 0) have higher maximum temperatures.
